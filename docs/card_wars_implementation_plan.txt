- ~~player object~~
- ~~turn structure: main phase, battle phase, pass turn~~

- ~~json-to-game-entity logic (asset manager)~~
- ~~refactor gameplay_manager and gameplay_classes~~
- ~~attack phase~~
- ~~skip first attack rule~~
- ~~create TriggerType enum, require it as param for Trigger init~~
- ~~figure out cw_lang integration~~
- ~~refactor convert existing trigger effects:~~
	- ~~per-turn draw~~

- ~~refactor game_logic: separate classes into own modules~~

- implement conditions
- properly implement triggers
- network message format and processing (local and peer)
- implement check_card_specific_requirements

NETWORK
- research / tests


Modifier Object: always has a deactivation trigger

NOTES:
- "-1" doesn't register as a digit -> but can be cast as int no problem
- can trigger conditions and effect filters use the same logic?
- maybe create EOT and WIP trigger objects as children of Trigger
